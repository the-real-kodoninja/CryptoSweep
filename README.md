# DeFiScraper

## üöÄ Overview

**DeFiScraper** is a powerful backend tool hosted at a URL (e.g., `defiscraper.yourdomain.com`), designed to harness the collective processing power of multiple servers to scrape the internet for digital assets. Its mission? To collect metadata and, where possible, fractions of *all altcoins*, *NFTs*, and tokenized stocks, then distribute them to a series of wallet addresses. Built for personal use, it‚Äôs a one-stop solution for exploring the wild world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and beyond.

## üåü Introduction

DeFiScraper lives on a URL, tapping into server clusters to scour crypto exchanges, NFT marketplaces, and stock platforms. It‚Äôs not just about data‚Äîit‚Äôs about collecting fragments of the digital economy, from Bitcoin dust to rare NFTs, and funneling them into your wallets. Think of it as your personal DeFi treasure hunter.

## üî• Features

-   **Distributed Scraping**: Leverages multiple servers for parallel data collection.
-   **Comprehensive Coverage**: Targets all altcoins (even fractions), NFTs, and tokenized stocks.
-   **Wallet Distribution**: Automatically sends collected assets to multiple wallet addresses.
-   **Backend Power**: Runs on a hosted URL with scalable cloud infrastructure.
-   **Real-time Processing**: Gathers and processes data as it flows from the internet.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Hosted Backend**: Deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS) with a custom URL.
2.  **Distributed Scraping**: Tasks split across servers to scrape:
    -   Crypto exchanges (Binance, CoinGecko).
    -   NFT marketplaces (OpenSea, Rarible).
    -   Stock platforms (Yahoo Finance, tokenized assets).
3.  **Asset Collection**: Gathers metadata for all assets, claims free tokens (e.g., airdrops), and buys fractions where feasible.
4.  **Distribution**: Sends assets to a predefined list of wallet addresses.

## üíé Supported Assets

### Cryptocurrencies

-   **All Altcoins**: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and every token listed on major exchanges, down to the smallest fraction.
-   **Examples**: DOGE, SHIB, MATIC, and thousands more.

### NFTs

-   **All Collectibles**: From CryptoPunks to free mints on OpenSea, Rarible, and beyond.

### Stocks

-   **Tokenized Assets**: Digital versions of stocks (e.g., Tesla, Apple) on blockchain platforms.
-   **Metadata**: Traditional stock data from public sources.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

-   **Backend**: Node.js/Express or Python/Flask, hosted on AWS EC2 or similar.
-   **Distributed System**: Celery + Redis for task queuing across multiple server instances.
-   **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store scraped data and wallet info.
-   **APIs**: CoinGecko, OpenSea, Binance, etc., for structured data.
-   **Blockchain**: `ethers.js` for wallet interactions and asset transfers.

## üîó Wallet Integration

-   Supports MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and others.
-   Configure a list of wallet addresses in `config.json` for automated distribution.
-   Example:

    ```json
    {
        "wallets": ["0xYourAddress1", "0xYourAddress2"]
    }
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1.  **Set Up Environment:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/DeFiScraper.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/yourusername/DeFiScraper.git)
    cd DeFiScraper
    npm install # or pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Configure:** Add API keys (CoinGecko, Binance, etc.) and wallet addresses to `config.json`.
3.  **Deploy:**

    ```bash
    npm start # Local test
    # Deploy to AWS/Heroku with your URL
    ```

4.  **Run:** Access `defiscraper.yourdomain.com/scrape` to start scraping.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

-   **Multi-chain Expansion**: Support for Solana, BSC, and more.
-   **Analytics**: Track asset performance and optimize collection.
-   **UI Dashboard**: Optional frontend for monitoring (if you expand beyond personal use).
